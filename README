My current Vim config that works both on linux and on windows (to a greater or lesser extent), there are a lot of convenience mappings to make life easier as well as a whole bunch of plugins to make Vim not only a great general editor but a pretty powerful programming IDE (or reasonable fascimile). Quite a few of the convenience mappings I borrowed from amix - http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html (to give credit where credit is due, it's more than just a few, probably 70% or more of my vimrc, I borrowed from his - long live open source :)).

Installing it
-----------------------
On linux it is pretty easy:

- check out from github into a directory in your home directory:
>cd ~
>git clone git://github.com/skorks/better-vim-config.git blah

- then simply execute the install.sh script that you will find in there
>blah/install.sh

The script will do a couple of things that you need to be aware of:

- it will create a .vimrc file in your home directory, which will wipe out any existing one if you already have one, so make sure to backup if you don't want it wiped out (automatic backup is on my list of things to do)
- it will rename the directory where the install script lives to be called .vimruntime if it is not already named that, this is to make sure all paths function correctly
- so after the install script has completed you should have:
  - a brand new .vimrc in your home directory (which points at a .vimruntime directory also in your home dir)
  - a .vimruntime directory where all the plugins and the real config live (what you checked out from github)
