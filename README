potential plugins to look at
java_getset or something similar
java organise imports plugin or similar
java shell plugin (beanshell) for quick experiments
python.vim for python
look at python_editing.vim for automatic folding and execute script binding
find plugin to do automtic ruby, java and c folding
javacomplete to enable omni completion for java
c.vim plugin for c development
mru.vim (most recently used documents plugin, have a look at this one)
scratch.vim - create and use a vim scratch buffer - may already have this one in current config
zoomwin plugin - to maximize and restore windows


need configurations for java, ruby, python, c and ability to easily switch between them, need to be able to easily add new configurations (javscript, clojure etc)
tabs should not be replaced by spaces, but should set how many spaces a tab should be 


stuff to do for new configuration
mod installer so that it only works for linux, will never work for windows anyway, don't use mac
ook at vim :make and :set makeprg=mvn and allow this to be different for all the configurations
a way to view ruby, python, java documentation directly from the editor
ability to quickly execute script, python, ruby though key combination to see the errors quickly
ability to compile currently edited java file either with keystroke or automatically
look at vim autocmd to automatically run commands when certain types of files are edited

figure out if snipmate is working properly on linux, not too much of an issue if not working on windows



need an installer, for linux it will create a .vimrc file if one doesn't already exit and also create a .vimruntime directory where plugins and so forth as well as the real config will live
for windows if will create a _vimrc file and a _vimruntime directory

will need programming language specific configurations figure out how to detect this automatically based on type of file as well as how to set it up manually as well as platform specific via the mysys function
